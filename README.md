### Turtle Race (Python, Turtle, messagebox)
- Created python application where four different turtles are drawn on the main screen and they race with eachother.
- Each four turtles are assigned with random speed everytime untill they finish the racce.
- Worked with python features like turtle and messagebox to design the UI.
